## What we do and how we feel

Habit tracking is a useful tool to bring new daily activities into the fold or to track pesky time wasting activities 
that leech our valuable time an energy. Much of our everyday behaviours are akin to walking on a well travelled dirt 
path; the path is travelled because it's  familiar and worn-in. And the path is worn because it's travelled. This simple 
application will harness the slow and steady strength of habit formation by providing the user with a a trusty,
 discrete accountability partner in their pocket. The app will aid the user in blazing new paths and returning the
 habits that they've outgrown to nature.

This app will be used by people who would like to track their habits on the basis that they choose, 
and log this information for a later date. This interests me because I am currently storing this information for myself
in a text file. It's time to improve my habit tracking setup.
